# options.toml: This file contains general options for the code

# subtract_cubic: This controls how the continuum will be subtracted during the
# line fitting step. If true, a cubic spline fit to the continuum will be subtracted.
# Otherwise, the actual fit to the continuum will be subtracted.
subtract_cubic = false

# overwrite: This controls what to do in case the fit for a certain spaxel
# has already been performed / saved.  If true, the fit will be performed again
# and the old one will be overwritten.  Otherwise, it won't.
overwrite = false

# track_memory: This controls whether an additional log file is saved for each
# spaxel which specifically tracks the memory usage / allocations during the
# spaxel fitting. Useful if memory usage is higher than expected.
track_memory = false

# track_convergence: Similarly, this controls whether an additional log file is
# generated which prints convergence information for each spaxel fit (but only
# for the LINE fit). Be warned that the way Optim.jl works with the simulated
# annealing method SAMIN makes it always print "status: failure" even if convergence
# was reached. The way to tell whether convergence was ACTUALLY reached is if
# the number of iterations reached the maximum (which is 10^6 by default).
track_convergence = true

# make_movies: Whether or not to save mp4 files of the data and final models of
# IFU cubes. This option require the user to have FFMPeg (https://ffmpeg.org/),
# as well as the FFMPeg and Astropy python packages, installed on their system.
# These are not necessarily scientifically useful, but they're pretty to watch.
make_movies = false

# save_full_model: Whether or not to save the full model of each spaxel in IFU cube
# format. If false, the model parameters will still be saved (the model can be
# easily reconstructed by simply rerunning the code with this option enabled, as the
# fitting data for each spaxel will already be saved)
save_full_model = true

# extinction_curve: May be "kvt" for the Kemper, Vriend, & Tielens (2004) 
# extinction profile, "ct" for the Chiar & Tielens (2005) extinction profile,
# or "d+" for the Donnan et al. (2022) extinction profile.
extinction_curve = "d+"

# extinction_screen: Controls whether extinction is modeled as e^-tau (true) or
# (1 - e^-tau) / tau (false), following PAHFIT.
extinction_screen = false

# whether or not to fit silicate emission
fit_sil_emission = false

# whether or not to use simulated annealing on ALL spaxels (if false, only uses it for the initial fit
# to the sum of all spaxels, and subsequent individual-spaxel fits are only done with a local Lev-Mar fit,
# which is typically sufficient as long as the lines one wishes to fit are prominent in the sum of all spaxels)
fit_all_samin = false

# cosmology options: Controls the cosmology used for distance / luminosity calculations.
# If h is set to 1, the distances in plot scale bars will be shown with h^-1 units.
