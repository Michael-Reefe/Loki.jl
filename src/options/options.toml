# parallel: Whether or not to utilize multiple CPUs to fit spaxels in parallel

# between processes, whereas distributed simply allocates an equal amount of jobs to each CPU.

# plot_spaxels: The plotting backend for 1D spaxel fits. Can be "pyplot", "plotly", or "both".

# save_fits: Whether or not to save the model parameters and the model itself as FITS files at the end of fitting.

# lines_allow_negative: Whether or not to allow the amplitudes of emission lines to go negative. Disabled by default.
# This also changes the units of the output for line amplitudes and fluxes from log10(erg/s/cm2) to erg/s/cm2.

# and the old one will be overwritten.  Otherwise, it won't.

# track_memory: This controls whether an additional log file is saved for each
# spaxel which specifically tracks the memory usage / allocations during the
# spaxel fitting. Useful if memory usage is higher than expected.

# track_convergence: Similarly, this controls whether an additional log file is
# generated which prints convergence information for each spaxel fit (but only
# for the LINE fit). Be warned that the way Optim.jl works with the simulated
# annealing method SAMIN makes it always print "status: failure" even if convergence
# was reached. The way to tell whether convergence was ACTUALLY reached is if
# the number of iterations reached the maximum (which is 10^6 by default).

# make_movies: Whether or not to save mp4 files of the data and final models of
# IFU cubes. This option require the user to have FFMPeg (https://ffmpeg.org/),

# These are not necessarily scientifically useful, but they're pretty to watch.

# save_full_model: Whether or not to save the full model of each spaxel in IFU cube

# easily reconstructed by simply rerunning the code with this option enabled, as the
# fitting data for each spaxel will already be saved)
