To-do list:

- Allow WAVE-TAB handling in WCS parameters for non-uniform wavelength grid inputs

- Make a combine_observations function to combine multiple data cubes of the same channel(s) with some pointing offset

- Allow parallelization with bootstrapping (but maybe make it mutually exclusive with spaxel parallelization...?)
