To-do list:

- Allow WAVE-TAB handling in WCS parameters for non-uniform wavelength grid inputs

- Make a combine_observations function to combine multiple data cubes of the same channel(s) with some pointing offset

- Remove FSPS dependence by generating hi-res stellar templates myself ahead of time, and distributing the templates as a file
  (then the stellar template generation just has to resample onto the observations' wavelength grid and broadened by the inst. width)

- Allow parallelization with bootstrapping (but maybe make it mutually exclusive with spaxel parallelization...?)
